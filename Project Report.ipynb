Human Traffic:-\n        The amount of people to which the location is accessible and how much traffic, both foot and vehicle does the neighbourhood experiences.\n        The higher the score, the better the neighbourhood is to set up a Food Business.\n    2. Competition:-\n        Although a business must be setup in an area with lesser competition, absence thereof might indicate either unrealized potential or the location \n        not being good enough. However a moderate presence of competition of similar, both vaguely and completely, business's points to an ideal\n        neighbourhood. \n        As close to moderate the score is, the better the neighbourhood is to set up a Food Business.\n    3. Location Cost:-\n        Depending on how pricey the business's in the area are, one might be able to determine the cost of the location.\n        The lower the cost, the better the neighbourhood is to set up a Food Business.\n        \nThe project aims to create clusters of neighbourhood based on the different scores for the aformentioned factors of a neighbourhood.\nIt may also suggest the best out of those clusters to set up a new Food Business.\n\nTarget Audience: To help those who might be looking to open a new food business in Manchester or let this be served as an example of how to \n                 look for a neighbourhood to open a similar food business.",
